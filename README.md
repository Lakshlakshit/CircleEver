# CircleEver

This repo is a part of compose camp. 

## 🎯 Agenda 

We are planning to connect the whole university through this app, so that all become aware of the different societies present to showcase their talents. We have built an Android app using Jetpack Compose for interactions of freshers and others with the societies present in the university, as these may turn out to be talent searchers for all.
